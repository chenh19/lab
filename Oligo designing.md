# Oligo designing

First of all, to understand why a ~20bp sequence can be unique in the whole genome, you may do the calculation below:  
In general, you may assume that for a nucleotide, the probability of it to be A, T, C, or G is 1/4  
Then, for an oligo with a length of N bp, the probability of a specific sequence is (1/4)^N
Human genome is about 3 billion bp,

So when N >= 16, a sequence can be considered as unique in the whole genome

Second, 3 ways to 

## Primers for PCR and genotyping
- ~500bp fragment
- Forward and reverse
- Tm: 58-60 Â°C
- Length 16-30bp

> Usually GC%, but if Tm and Length are within range, GC% will be good

## Primers for whole coding region sequencing
PCR


## Guide RNAs for gene knock-out



## Prime editing gRNAs for variants knock-in

### pegRNA for the strand to be edited

### gRNA for the non-edited strand
