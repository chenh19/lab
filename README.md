#  Undergraduate students training plan
**A general training pipeline for undergraduate students in [Braunstein Lab](http://www.braunstein.team/)**  
*Current version: v1.0.3*

## Basics
*Each basic steps takes around 2 weeks (assuming the student comes twice a week)*

#### lab basics
- basic rules in the lab (safety, trash/sharp handling)
- basic equipment using (pipttes: manual/eletronicl/multiple; centrifuges; waterbath; cell culture hood; vacuum)
- [cell culturing](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/protocols/biology/cell-types-culture.html) ([ATCC cell lines](https://www.atcc.org/en/Products/Cells_and_Microorganisms/Cell_Lines.aspx); [aseptic technique](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics.html), microscope, countess; culturing without antibiotics)
- notes keeping and literature searching/managing ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/); [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/))
- weekly meeting with [Dr. Braunstein](http://www.braunstein.team/)

#### basic genetic experiments
- [DNA extraction](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/purelink_genomic_man.pdf) (understand principles; from cell/blood/saliva)
- [PCR](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cloning/cloning-learning-center/invitrogen-school-of-molecular-biology/pcr-education/pcr-reagents-enzymes/pcr-basics.html) (understand principles; SnapGene for sequences managing and primer designing)

#### basic cell experiments
- [Flowcytometry](https://www.abcam.com/protocols/introduction-to-flow-cytometry) (cell prep; single staining; Calibur machine using)
- [FlowJo](https://www.flowjo.com/solutions/flowjo) (raw flow data managing, gating, analyzing MFI)


## Advanced
*Each advanced steps takes around 3-4 weeks (one doesn't have to learn all, but should fully understand the principles of one set of the advanced experiments, and should always learn data analyzing and graphing)*

#### advanced cell experiments
- proliferation curve
- [viability test; mHAM](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/protocols/biology/roche/cell-proliferation-reagent-wst-1.html)

#### advanced genetic experiments
- [Sanger sequencing](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-molecular-genetics/hs-biotechnology/a/dna-sequencing)
- [qRT-PCR](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/ambion-tech-support/rtpcr-analysis/general-articles/rt--pcr-the-basics.html)

#### advanced protein experiments
- [Elisa](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-biology-learning-center/protein-biology-resource-library/pierce-protein-methods/overview-elisa.html)
- [Western blot](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-biology-learning-center/protein-biology-resource-library/pierce-protein-methods/overview-western-blotting.html)

#### data analyzing and graphing
- [FlowJo](https://www.flowjo.com/solutions/flowjo)
- [GraphPad Prism](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/)
- [Adobe illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)


## Project begins (after 3 months)
The student should be proficient in at least one set of the advanced experiments and able to conduct a small **downstream** project independently


## More advanced (after 1 year)
- [NGS library preparation](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-brand/ampliseq.html)
- [Fast medium-scale data processing with Excel](https://github.com/chenh19/lab_training/blob/master/excel_tutorial.md)
- [Fast large-scale data processing with BRStudio](https://github.com/chenh19/BRStudio)
- [Preliminary *in silico* research (sturctural and functional predictions)](https://github.com/chenh19/lab_training/blob/master/in_silico_research.md)
- [DNA Oligo designing (for PCR, qPCR, sequencing, and CRISPR)](https://github.com/chenh19/lab_training/blob/master/oligo_designing.md)
- **Training other students**
- Other **upstream** projects
