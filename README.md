# Braunstein lab training pipeline for undergrad students
*v1.0.0*

## Basics
*Each basic steps takes around 2 weeks (assuming the student comes twice a week)*

#### lab basics
- basic rules in the lab (safety, trash/sharp handling)
- basic equipment using (pipttes: manual/eletronicl/multiple; centrifuges; waterbath; cell culture hood; vacuum)
- cell culturing (aseptic technique, microscope, countess)
- notes keeping and literature searching/managing (mendeley)

#### basic genetic experiments
- DNA extraction (understand principles; from cell/blood/saliva)
- PCR (understand principles; SnapGene for sequences managing and primer designing)

#### basic cell experiments
- Flowcytometry (cell prep; single staining; Calibur machine using)
- FlowJo (raw flow data managing, gating, analyzing MFI)


## Advanced
*Each advanced steps takes around 3-4 weeks (one doesn't have to learn all, but should fully understand the principles of one set of experiments, and should always learn data analyzing and graphing)*

#### advanced cell experiments
- proliferation curve
- viability test; mHAM

#### advanced genetic experiments
- sanger sequencing
- RT-PCR
- qPCR

#### advanced protein experiments
- Elisa
- Western blot

#### data analyzing and graphing
- FlowJo Layout
- GraphPad prism
- Adobe illustrator


## Project begins (after 3 months)
The student should be proficient in at least one type of advanced experiments and able to conduct a small **downstream** project independently


## More advanced (after 1 year)
- genetic engineering and cell line generating pipeline
- NGS pipeline
- other **upstream** projects
